# Creating a Task

You can create a new task from two main locations:

1. **Within "My Tasks" > "Upcoming", click the blue "+ Add New" button.**
2. **Within "Events", click a specific show > "Task" and click the blue "+ Add New" button.**

#### Quick Create Task

1. Click the "+ Add New" button
2. Enter who the task is assigned to and a title.
3. Optionally select a description, category and show
4. Select a due date
5. Click "Save"

#### New Task Fields Details

* **Who is this assigned to (required)** - Select the person who you wish to assign the task to.
  * Note that multiple team members _can_ be assigned to one task. However, since they share a single task, the status will update for ALL team members anytime the status changes.
* **Name (required)** - The task title. Do not include the show name.
* **Description** - An optional description of the task or place to keep notes. Rich text is allowed, including section headers, quotes, links, bold, italics, lists and checklists.

    * The task creation date
    * The show announce date
    * The show on sale date
    * The show date
* **Due Date** - The date that the task is due
