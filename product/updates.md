* **Repeat Tasks**
  * For tasks that are not associated with a specific event, you can now have them automatically repeat upon completion.  For example, if you want the task "Create a monthly calendar social media graphic" that repeats every 30 days, you can set that up.  Once the task is moved to _Done_, a new task will be created that's X days out from the old due date.\
    \
    You can access this when creating a new task under _Date Settings._  Repeatable tasks are denoted with a â†» symbol.
