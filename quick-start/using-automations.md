# Using Automations



We've now built an event and filled out important information. Let's use Sparrow's built-in automations to iterate off of that info.

{% hint style="info" %}
Automations can take up to 5 minutes to run.  You can leave the automations page at any time and they will continue to run in the background.
{% endhint %}

1. **Go to the Event Details page**. From the homepage, <mark style="color:green;">click Events</mark> in the navigation.  In the search bar <mark style="color:green;">type "My Sparrow Test Event"</mark> and click on the card that appears in the search results.
2. **Go to the Automations section.** From the Event Details page, <mark style="color:green;">click the "..."</mark> next to the Tasks tab to open a dropdown of additional tabs.  <mark style="color:green;">Select Automations</mark> and <mark style="color:green;">click + Add New</mark> to add a new automation.  Enter the following information:\
   \
   &#x20; Automation: _Do some research_\
   &#x20; Click Save\
   \
   Select + Add New again and enter:\
   &#x20; Automation: _Create marketing plan_\
   &#x20; Marketing Plan: _Demo marketing plan_\
   &#x20; Click Save\
   \
   Select + Add New again and enter:\
   &#x20; Automation: _Create Graphics_\
   &#x20; Graphics: _Demo: Square (On Sale)_ and _Demo: Landscape_\
   &#x20; Click Save\
   \
   Select + Add New again and enter:\
   &#x20; Automation: _Merge Email Template_\
   &#x20; Template:  _Demo: Agent email_\
   &#x20; Click Save\
   \
   Select + Add New again and enter:\
   &#x20; Automation: _Add Task Groups_\
   &#x20; Task Groups: _Demo: In House_\
   &#x20; Click Save\

3. **Review your completed automations.**  From the Event Details page, go back to the Automations tab to view their status.  If they are 'Done', then move on to the following steps:\
   \
   _Click "Do Some Research"_. Look at 'Genre', 'Similar Artists', and listen to a few tracks.  Use this information to update event info in your Event Details page (e.g. Similar artists).\
   \
   Go back to your Automations tab and click "_Create Marketing Plan_".  Right-click each image and select 'Save As' to save it to your computer.  Upload these graphics to the _Assets_ tab in your Event Details page.\
   \
   Go back to your Automations tab and click "_Create Graphics_".  Click 'PDF' to download the marketing plan as a PDF.  Use this to create a marketing plan that can be sent to the agent or internal team.\
   \
   Go back to your Automations tab and click "_Merge Email Template"_.  Use this automation to quickly write emails, such as a welcome email to the agent in this example.\
   \
   Go back to your Automations tab and click "_Add Task Group"_.  This will give you a summary of tasks that have been created, which we will cover more in the next section.\


Congratulations! In just a few clicks we've started building out assets, such as graphics, plans, emails, etc.  Next, let's dive into Sparrow's powerful task manager.
